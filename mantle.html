                    <p class="game-summary">An MFA thesis project where you play as the crime-fighting robot Mantle,
                        master dozens of minigames, and witness the origin story of an unexpected villain.</p>

                        <h2>Project Info</h2>
                        <p><b>Team Size</b>: 30+</p>
                        <p><b>Role</b>: Engineer</p>

            <div class="desc">
                <h2>Key Contributions:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrative system that pulls from Google Sheets to JSON and into game</li>
                    <li>Dynamic text and news video playback</li>
                    <li>Diegetic desktop interface</li>
                    <li>Custom minigames for each of the 6 enemies</li>
                    <li>Numerous bugfixes and small features across the project</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As one of just <b>3 engineers</b>, I had ownership of a large portion of the game, along with the added responsibility of communicating with almost every other team on the project:
                    adding artwork, sound, and narrative into engine, understanding the goals of the design team and implementing their ideas, and <b>meeting weekly</b> with the director and lead producer to set <b>timelines</b> for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was especially effective in this role because my <b>design skills</b> complemented the purely technical skill of the other two engineers. While my Lead Engineer implemented backend systems and editor tools,
                    I was able to consistently deliver corresponding <b>frontend</b> features that were polished and <b>easy to use</b>, helping translate between the pure engineers and the art and design teams.
                </p>
                <img src="/static/images/Mantle Desktop.gif" alt="Desktop" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <p>I not only wrote the underlying code for this interface but also added color-coding, spacing, <b>reformatted our narrative documents</b> to work with the dynamic dialogue,
                    <b>edited the UI layout</b> for readability, and added a number of color transitions and animations. I wasn't required to add these
                    improvements, but spent my <b>free time</b> to include them because I was motivated to make the project as polished as possible.
