                <h1>Mantle (2025)</h1>
                <p>An MFA thesis project where you play as the crime-fighting robot Mantle,
                    master dozens of minigames, and witness the origin story of an unexpected villain.</p>

                <h2>What I Did</h2>
                <p>As one of just <b>3 engineers</b>, I had ownership of a large portion of the game, along with the added responsibility of <b>communicating</b> with almost every other team on the project:
                    adding artwork, sound, and narrative into engine, understanding the goals of the design team and implementing their ideas, and <b>meeting weekly</b> with the director and lead producer to set <b>timelines</b> for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was especially effective in this role because my <b>design skills</b> complemented the purely technical skill of the other two engineers. While my Lead Engineer implemented backend systems and editor tools,
                    I was able to consistently deliver the corresponding <b>frontend</b> features that were polished and <b>easy to use</b>, helping translate between the pure engineers and the art and design teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, I built almost every aspect of the <b>desktop scene</b>, which plays between every
                    battle and delivers the majority of the game's story.
                </p>
                <img src="/static/images/Mantle Desktop.gif" alt="Desktop">
                <p>In order to get this scene functioning as well as it does, I not only wrote the underlying code but also added color-coding, spacing, <b>reformatted our narrative documents</b>
                    to work with the dynamic dialogue, <b>edited the UI files</b> for readability, and added a number of color transitions and animations. I wasn't even tasked with doing most of these
                    improvements, but spent my <b>free time</b> to include them because I cared about the project working as well as possible. As a result, <i>Mantle</i> has consistently been noted as one of the only MFA projects
                    that is <b>on schedule</b> and looking like a <b>polished game</b>.
