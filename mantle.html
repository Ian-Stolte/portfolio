                <h2>Working with a large team</h2>
                <p>Creating a game alongside a team of <b>over 20 people</b> has been a very different experience from solo development,
                    but the interdisciplinary skillset I built making games on my own proved to be a perfect fit for the Mantle engineering team! As one of just 3 engineers,
                    I still have <b>ownership</b> of a large portion of the game, but have the added responsibility of <b>communicating</b> with almost every other team on the project:
                    adding artwork, sound, and narrative into engine, understanding the goals of the design team and implementing their ideas, and <b>meeting weekly</b> with
                    the director and lead producer to set <b>timelines</b> for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I've been so effective in this programming role is that I complement the purely technical skill of the other engineers. While my team
                    members—upperclassmen and grad students—handle the most complex backend tasks, I am consistently delivering features that <b>look good</b> and are <b>easy to use</b>,
                    helping translate between the pure engineers and the art and design teams. For example, I built almost every aspect of the <b>desktop scene</b>, which plays between every
                    battle and delivers the majority of the game's story.
                </p>

                <p>In order to get this scene functioning as well as it does, I not only wrote the underlying code but also added color-coding, spacing, <b>reformatted our narrative documents</b>
                    to work with the dynamic dialogue, <b>edited the UI files</b> for readability, and added a number of color transitions and animations. I wasn't even tasked with doing most of these
                    improvements, but spent my free time to include them because I cared about the project working as well as possible. As a result, Mantle has consistently been noted as one of the <b>only</b> MFA projects
                    that is <b>on schedule</b> and looking like a <b>polished game</b>.
