                <p>A multiplayer sci-fi game where you must work together to control your spaceship,
                    navigate through a dense asteroid belt, and try to survive long enough for help to arrive.</p>

                <h2>Networked multiplayer</h2>
                <p><i>Stranded</i> was a semester-long project for an advanced computer science class, where I designed and pitched the original idea, was selected by my peers, then recruited and directed a small team to take the project to completion. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players simultaneously control different stations on the <b>same spaceship</b>, and rapdily swap between them to keep all systems running. For example, one player might detemine how fast the spaceship's engines thrust while the other player controls its steering, then the first player
                    might swap to the shield station to block an incoming asteroid. Given the timeframe, this type of multiplayer functionality was very ambitious but we were ultimately successful.
                </p>
                <p>I used Unity's Netcode framework to designate one player as the server and enable <b>client connection</b> from other players on the same network. In order to synchronize the game state, I wrote a number of functions to <b>track
                    the state of the ship</b> and pass it across the network, including the dynamic physics of the Steering and Thrusters stations. However, this was made more complex by the fact that, unlike a traditional multiplayer game, both <b>players share
                    the same character</b>. To solve this problem, I wrote custom logic to shift control of position and rotation reporting between the host and client as players moved between different stations, efficiently allowing the game to stay in sync
                    after any configuration of player actions.
                </p>

                <!--p>The class was structured to simulate an industry environment, allowing me to gain invaluable experience with planning, presenting progress, and iterating on a project over a longer period of time.</p-->
