                <h2>Project management</h2>
                <p><i>The Lobby</i> was initially created as part of a 4-week college-level game design program at Digipen Institute of Technology, where I worked
                    with a 7-person team of game artists, designers, and programmers to prototype this narrative platformer. Because we were given <b>no strict team structure</b>,
                    a massive part of the project was establishing the <b>organization</b> and <b>planning</b> necessary to complete a playable build within just a few weeks. As the team
                    member with the most experience, I quickly stepped up as the <b>de facto director</b>, helping assign one team member to SFX, another to level design, and working
                    with the art team to create a cohesive art direction. In addition to these responsibilities, I took a lead engineering role, writing almost every line of code and collaborating
                    with my team members to implement their content into the build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the program, our game was acknowledged as the <b>most complete</b> out of 10 different games, and our professors offered us a <b>unique opportunity</b> to support the continued development
                    of the game and work toward an eventual <b>Steam release</b>.
