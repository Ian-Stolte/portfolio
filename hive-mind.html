                <h2>Just 48 hours</h2>
                <p>I created <i>Hive Mind</i> for Ludum Dare 56, a game jam that challenged me to create a complete project from scratch in just 2 days. The process was intense, but a strong focus on <b>organization</b> and
                    <b>planning ahead</b> allowed me to stay relatively stress-free and complete all the features I had planned. I drafted a detailed schedule to help me keep moving, and prioritized breaks, meals, and sleep not only as
                    essential for my wellbeing but as opportunities to step away from the project and see it from a different perspective. As I narrowed down my idea, I added more specific list items to the schedule and created
                    a <b>Trello board</b> with every feature I might want to implement, sorted by priority.
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
                    <img src="/static/images/Hive Mind Schedule.png" alt="Hive Mind Schedule" style="height: 600px; width: auto;">
                    <img src="/static/images/Hive Mind Trello.png" alt="Hive Mind Trello" style="height: 600px; width: auto;">
                </div>
                <p>I didn't stop there though: after the 48 hours ended, I played and reviewed dozens of other games to boost <i>Hive Mind</i>'s visibility, had <b>conversations</b> with many other designers who left comments on my game,
                    and <b>proactively solicited feedback</b> on the most desired features I had missed. I received a resounded call for better pathfinding and more ways to control the ants, so in the 2 weeks that followed I
                    <b>taught myself A* pathfinding</b>, implemented a much more dynamic drag-to-select system, drastically improved game balance and pacing, and made it much easier to tell which ants you were controlling.
                    My previously-established Trello board proved crucial for sorting through the feedback and aligning it with my own goals, allowing me to effectively work with a large group of playtesters and
                    <b>rapidly iterate</b> on a single idea.
                </p>
