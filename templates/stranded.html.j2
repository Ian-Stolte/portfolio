            <p>Stranded was a semester-long project for an advanced computer science class, with the help of 2 classmates.
                I developed the original idea & pitched it, wrote most of the code (including networked multiplayer), and scored the game (see video below).
                The class was structured to simulate an industry environment, allowing me to gain invaluable experience with planning, presenting progress, and iterating on a project over a longer period of time.</p>
